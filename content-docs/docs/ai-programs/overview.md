- ROS 2 for communication
- Nav 2 for navigation
- DeepSeek LLM for intelligence
- Motor Control for actuation

## Structure

AI programs follow standard ROS 2 package structure with additional ROBOCON-specific components.

## Development Workflow

1. **Develop** - Create your application
2. **Package** - Package for deployment
3. **Deploy** - Deploy to robot or simulator
4. **Share** - Optionally share on marketplace

## Examples

- [Red Flag Detection Example](examples/red-flag-detection.md) - Complete BehaviorTree.CPP application example

## Next Steps

- [Packaging](packaging.md) - Package your application as .deb
- [Deployment](deployment.md) - Deploy to robots
- [Marketplace Integration](marketplace-integration.md) - Share with community
