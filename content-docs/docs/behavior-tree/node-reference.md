# Behavior Tree Node Reference

This document provides an overview of Behavior Tree nodes available in ROBOCON OS. The complete node reference is split into two comprehensive pages:

## Node Types

### Low-Level Nodes

**Low-level nodes** represent hard-coded functionality or close-to-hard-coded operations. These nodes directly interface with hardware actuators and sensors, providing precise control over robot components. They execute deterministic operations with minimal inference or planning.

**See:** [Low-Level Nodes Reference](low-level-nodes.md)

### High-Level Nodes

**High-level nodes** use inference and reasoning to develop execution plans. These nodes may:
- Generate sequences of low-level actions
- Create complex behavior tree subtrees dynamically
- Make context-aware decisions based on environment state
- Plan multi-step operations using the TSBT-VLA System

**See:** [High-Level Nodes Reference](../api-reference/behavior-tree-high-level-nodes.md)

## Quick Reference

For detailed documentation, examples, and C++ implementation guides, see the dedicated pages:

- **[Low-Level Nodes](low-level-nodes.md)** - Direct hardware control nodes with BehaviorTree.CPP v4.6+ examples
- **[High-Level Nodes](../api-reference/behavior-tree-high-level-nodes.md)** - Intelligent planning and reasoning nodes with BehaviorTree.CPP v4.6+ examples

## Node Usage in Behavior Trees

### Basic XML Structure

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root BTCPP_format="4" main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
    <BehaviorTree ID="MainTree">
        <Sequence name="LiftOperation">
            <Boom_Extend Extention="10"/>
            <Boom_Lift Extention="0.4"/>
            <Pulley_Lift Distance="4"/>
            <Hook_Release Mode="Controlled Drop" Height="2m"/>
        </Sequence>
    </BehaviorTree>
</root>
```

### Combining Low-Level and High-Level Nodes

High-level nodes can generate sequences of low-level nodes:

```xml
<Sequence name="CompleteLiftOperation">
    <!-- High-level planning node -->
    <Travel_Plan From="{Current Location}" To="Construction Site"/>
    
    <!-- High-level object detection -->
    <Visual_Find ObjectClass="Sheathing_Stack" objectId="{sheathingId}"/>
    
    <!-- Sequence of low-level boom movements -->
    <Boom_Slewing Rotation="270"/>
    <Boom_Extend Extention="5"/>
    <Boom_Lift Extention="0.4"/>
    <Pulley_Lift Distance="3"/>
    
    <!-- High-level release -->
    <Hook_Release Mode="Controlled Drop" Height="2m"/>
</Sequence>
```

### Using Blackboard Variables

Nodes can share data through the blackboard:

```xml
<Sequence name="ObjectManipulation">
    <!-- Find object and store ID in blackboard -->
    <Visual_Find ObjectClass="Red Cup" objectId="{cupId}"/>
    
    <!-- Use stored ID for picking -->
    <Object_Pick Object_Name="{cupId}" Gripper="Suction"/>
    
    <!-- Place object -->
    <Object_Place Location="Table 3" Gripper="Suction"/>
</Sequence>
```

## Integration with TSBT-VLA System

High-level nodes are particularly powerful when used with the TSBT-VLA System, which can generate complex behavior tree subtrees dynamically based on natural language commands, scene context, and sensor data.

For more information on using these nodes with the TSBT-VLA System, see:
- [TSBT-VLA System Overview](../architecture/tsbt-vla-system/overview.md) - Complete system architecture
- [Large Language Model Processing](../architecture/tsbt-vla-system/llm-processing.md) - How nodes are generated by LLM
- [Behavior Trees API](../api-reference/behavior-trees.md) - BehaviorTree.CPP integration details

## Future Documentation

Individual pages may be created for specific action nodes to provide:
- Detailed motion diagrams
- Kinematic and dynamic analysis
- Safety considerations
- Advanced usage patterns
- Troubleshooting guides
