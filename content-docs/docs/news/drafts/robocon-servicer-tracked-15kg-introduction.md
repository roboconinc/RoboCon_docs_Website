Launching today, RoboCon’s new Servicer platform brings dual-arm robotic manipulation to construction sites, enabling workers to perform complex service and maintenance tasks with robotic precision. The RoboCon Servicer family comes in two variants—Tracked and Wheeled—designed to operate in diverse construction environments, from rough outdoor terrain to smooth indoor surfaces.

RoboCon, the construction robotics company revolutionizing jobsite operations with intelligent, autonomous robots, today announced the release of its new product family, the RoboCon Servicer. Developed over the past year, this versatile dual-arm service robot empowers construction workers with superhumanoid capabilities while maintaining the safety and collaboration that defines RoboCon's approach to construction automation.

## Empowering Construction Workers with Dual-Arm Precision

The RoboCon Servicer is designed to be operated by workers, using robotic precision to perform complex manipulation tasks that traditionally require multiple workers or specialized equipment. With dual 6-degree-of-freedom arms, each capable of lifting 15kg (33 lbs), the Servicer enables bimanual operations such as component assembly, equipment maintenance, material handling, and precision installation work. This dual-arm capability reduces the time required for complex tasks while improving consistency and reducing worker fatigue.

"The RoboCon Servicer is the first product in our full construction machine lineup, but what truly sets it apart is the platform it's built on," said Brad Lee, CEO of RoboCon. "We've created a developer-friendly ecosystem with an open SDK and a marketplace where the community can contribute and monetize microservices—think of it as the Apple App Store for construction robots. This isn't just a robot; it's the foundation of an entire platform that will continuously evolve and improve through community innovation."

## Two Variants for Every Environment

The RoboCon Servicer family launches with two models, each optimized for different construction environments:

**RoboCon Servicer Tracked 15kg**: Designed for outdoor construction sites and rough terrain, the Tracked variant features all-terrain mobility that enables operation on uneven surfaces, debris-laden areas, and challenging ground conditions. With its tracked base, the Servicer Tracked maintains stability and traction in the most demanding construction environments.

**RoboCon Servicer Wheeled 15kg**: Optimized for indoor construction, smooth surfaces, and controlled environments, the Wheeled variant offers enhanced efficiency and maneuverability on flat surfaces. Ideal for interior finishing work, equipment installation, and precision tasks in controlled construction zones.

Both models share the same dual-arm manipulation system, providing 30kg (66 lbs) total lifting capacity when both arms work together, with 1,500mm (5 feet) arm reach and 1mm precision that enables precise screwing operations and accurate pick-and-place tasks.

## Key Features

**Dual 6-DOF Robotic Arms**: Independent manipulation with 15kg payload capacity per arm, enabling coordinated bimanual operations for complex construction tasks.

**All-Terrain Capability (Tracked)**: Tracked mobility system provides superior traction and stability on rough, uneven construction surfaces.

**Extended Runtime**: 8+ hours of continuous operation per battery pack, enabling full-shift operations without recharging.

**Construction-Grade Design**: IP65 protection rating for dust and water resistance, ensuring reliable operation in harsh construction environments.

**Natural Language Control**: Built on ROBOCON OS with natural language interface, allowing workers to issue commands using voice or text that are converted into executable behavior trees.

**ROS 2 Integration**: Full ROS 2 ecosystem support enables seamless integration with construction automation systems, sensors, and planning tools.

- **Installation Work**: Precision installation of fixtures, equipment, and systems
- **Quality Control**: Inspection and verification of construction work
- **Human-Machine Collaboration**: Safe operation alongside construction workers

## Continuous Improvement Through Software Updates

Featuring over-the-air (OTA) software updates, RoboCon Servicer systems become more capable and productive with each new software upgrade. The platform benefits from RoboCon's AI Microservices Marketplace, where developers can create and distribute specialized modules for visual processing, planning logic, safety modules, and custom behaviors. This ensures that customers always have access to the most advanced robotic capabilities.

"For the first time in the history of construction robotics, the tools we are providing for our workers only get better after the initial purchase," said Brad Lee, CEO of RoboCon. "We are constantly improving the quality, safety, consistency, and productivity of our products through software updates and our marketplace ecosystem, enabling our clients to stay at the forefront of construction automation."

## Perfect Complement to the RoboCon Fleet

The RoboCon Servicer perfectly supplements the existing RoboCon fleet, which includes the Mini Crane, Outdoor Sheather, Transporter, and Mini Loader. With this new platform, the RoboCon fleet is now equipped to handle a comprehensive range of construction tasks including material handling, lifting operations, sheathing work, transportation, and now—with the Servicer—precise manipulation and service operations.

The Servicer's dual-arm design enables it to work alongside other RoboCon robots, creating coordinated construction workflows where multiple robots collaborate to complete complex projects. This multi-robot coordination, powered by RoboCon's zero-trust consensus protocol, ensures safe and efficient operation across the entire jobsite.

## About RoboCon
