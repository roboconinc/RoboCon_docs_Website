### RoboCon Announces Servicer: A Dual-Arm Robotic Platform for Precision Construction Automation

**Oakland, CA --- November 10, 2025** --- RoboCon Inc., the California-based pioneer in autonomous construction robotics, today announced the **design launch** of its new **RoboCon Servicer**, a dual-arm robotic platform engineered for high-precision on-site construction tasks. While the Servicer is not yet available for purchase, RoboCon has released detailed technical specifications and preliminary pricing to gauge early market interest and engage with development partners ahead of full production.

Developed to extend RoboCon's fleet of jobsite-deployable robots, the Servicer merges powerful manipulation, intelligent vision, and open-source software in a compact, collaborative design built for the rugged realities of modern construction sites.

## An Open Platform for Construction Robotics

The Servicer runs on **RoboCon OS**, an open-architecture control system built entirely with open-source technologies --- including **ROS 2**, **Nav 2**, and open-source **visual and language models**. This approach establishes a collaborative ecosystem and marketplace that encourages developers, integrators, and researchers to expand the robot's functionality.

The **RoboCon SDK** provides direct access to motor and sensor drivers, communication APIs, and ROS 2-based control layers, enabling developers to program new tools, behaviors, and applications for the Servicer and the broader RoboCon platform.

> "The Servicer is more than a machine --- it's a platform for innovation," said **Brad Lee**, CEO of RoboCon. "By combining open-source robotics with industrial-grade engineering, we're giving builders and developers a shared foundation to shape what comes next. If there's a new capability you want our robots to perform, our SDK and ROS 2 integration make it possible."

## Vision System: High-Fidelity Perception for Construction Tasks

The Servicer's vision system is powered by a next-generation **active stereo depth camera** designed for both indoor and outdoor use. Featuring anti-glare optics and synchronized RGB-D output, the system captures:

- **Depth resolution:** up to 1280 × 960 at 5 fps
- **Color imaging:** up to 1280 × 960 at 16 fps (YUYV format)
- **Z-axis accuracy:** approximately 0.8 mm at 800 mm
- **Point precision:** approximately 0.6 mm at 800 mm
- **Planarity:** approximately 0.8 mm at 800 mm

These performance levels provide **sub-millimeter 3D accuracy** for object recognition, localization, and manipulation. When combined with the Servicer's dual-arm motion system, the robot achieves **1 mm spatial accuracy** and **±0.08 mm repeatability**, allowing it to perform delicate tasks such as fastening, welding, or precision cutting directly on-site.

## Power and Reach

Weighing **800 kg (1,764 lbs)**, the Servicer provides a lift height of **2,000 mm (6.6 ft)** and arm reach of **1,500 mm (5 ft)**. Each arm features six degrees of freedom and a **15 kg (33 lb)** payload capacity, offering a combined **30 kg (66 lb)** lift. Its maximum joint speeds are optimized for smooth, safe interaction during collaborative operation.

The platform's high reach and heavy payload capabilities enable the Servicer to perform structural assembly, equipment handling, and precision operations at elevation --- all while maintaining operator safety and positional consistency.

## Versatile Jobsite Applications

The Servicer's modular architecture supports a wide range of tools and attachments for diverse construction and fabrication tasks, including:

- **Routing and Cutting:** Accurately cuts sheathing and drywall to size.
- **Material Handling and Assembly:** Performs precise pick-and-place operations and fixture installation.
- **Welding and Metalwork:** Executes fine, repeatable welds and structural joining.
- **Autonomous Support Tasks:** Assists in plugging charging cables or managing tools for other robotic systems.

The Servicer also operates within RoboCon's **patent-pending sheathing system** and incorporates a **patented construction platform design** based on **U.S. Patent US12379713B1 -- "Construction Workstation with Rotatable Platform."** This patented configuration features a rotating, liftable platform that integrates multiple tools for efficient, multi-step construction processes --- forming the foundation for RoboCon's coordinated robotic workflows.

## Early Access and Developer Collaboration

To encourage open collaboration and early adoption, RoboCon is publishing the Servicer's detailed specifications and inviting developers, researchers, and industry partners to participate in the platform's early-access phase. This initiative aims to refine real-world integrations, explore new use cases, and expand the capabilities of the RoboCon OS ecosystem.

> "We're sharing this design early because collaboration drives progress," said Lee. "By opening the platform to developers and construction innovators now, we're accelerating the evolution of autonomous building systems that work safely and intelligently alongside humans."
