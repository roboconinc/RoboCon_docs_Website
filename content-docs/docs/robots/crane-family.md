# RoboCon Crane Family

The RoboCon Crane Family encompasses a series of innovative foldable crane assemblies designed for construction, material handling, and autonomous operations. These cranes feature compact storage capabilities, rapid deployment, and configurable end modules for versatile operations.

## Family Overview

The RoboCon Crane Family includes:

- **Mini Crane Tracked 3000kg - Hydraulic**: Traditional hydraulic actuation system for high-power operations
- **Mini Crane Tracked 3000kg - Electric**: Full electric actuation system with advanced 5-joint outrigger system
- **Foldable Crane Patent**: Comprehensive patent documentation for the foldable crane assembly technology

## Key Innovations

### Compact Folding Design
All crane models in the family can fold to a footprint equal to or less than **1.2 m × 1.2 m**, enabling efficient storage and transport.

### Configurable End Modules
The end module system is automatically configurable to operate as:
- Hook assembly (rope/cable attachment)
- Vacuum-suction assembly
- Fork assembly
- Various end-effectors (robotic arms, drills, screwdrivers, etc.)

### Advanced Control Systems
- ROS 2 integration for autonomous operations
- Visual-language-action models for natural language control
- Multi-crane coordination capabilities
- Advanced sensor fusion (2D-LiDAR, 3D-LiDAR, IMU)
